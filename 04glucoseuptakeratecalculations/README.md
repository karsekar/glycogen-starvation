This folder has the following components:
* Figure6A.ipynb - iPython notebook to create figure 6 from the real-time metabolomics data
* gur_differences.slx - The MATLAB simulink model used to fit the data and calculate the apparent glucose uptake rate
* glgP_condition.mat - The summary MATLAB simulation results for the glgP condition
* wt_condition- The summary MATLAB simulation results for the wild-type condition
* individualpulses.xlsx - Excel format summary results of the data and fits. Used to make figure 6C.
